<h1>
Ability Activation Overview</h1>
The following is the basic outline of events that occur when an ability
is activated.&nbsp; This list represents the most common sequence of event
that occur during ability activation.&nbsp; Depending on the ability, some
or all of the list may be skipped.&nbsp; Source refers to the Character
activating the ability.&nbsp; Target refers to the Character(s) being affected
by the ability.&nbsp; Both must be a subclass of type Target.
<ol>
<li>
<u>Ability Preactivation Check</u> - preactivation Both Powers and all
Advantages/Limitations for the ability are executed.&nbsp; If any of the
<b>preactivation()</b>
methods return false, the power will not activate.&nbsp; However, END will
be charged for the power itself (but not for END for Strength use).&nbsp;
If all preactivation suceeds, proceed to next step.</li>

<li>
<u>Set Ability's ACTIVATED value/pair to TRUE</u> - The Ability's <i>Ability.ACTIVATED</i>
will be set to TRUE.</li>

<li>
<u>AbilityIsActivating Notification to Effects</u> - All Effects currently
applied to the Source will have their <b>abilityIsActivating()</b> method
executed.&nbsp; <b>AbilityIsActivating()</b> can be used to make effects
take particular actions whenever an ability starts activation, ie Combat
Skill Levels.</li>

<li>
<u>Ability OCV/DCV Modifiers Applied</u> - Any OCV/DCV modifiers attached
directly to the Ability are applied.&nbsp; An effectCombatModifier effect
is applied to Source, based upon the Ability.OCVMOD/Ability.DCVMOD value/pairs.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver Preactivation Check</u> - If the ability is being activated
along with a maneuver, the maneuver's preactivation() method is executed
for the maneuver's power and advantages/limitations.&nbsp; Failure will
deactivate both the maneuver and the ability.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver OCV/DCV Modifiers Applied</u> - If the is being activated along
with a maneuver, any OCV/DCV modifiers attached directly to the manuever
are applied.&nbsp; An effectCombatModifier effect is applied to Source.</li>

<li>
<u>Setup Knockback</u> - Knockback is setup in the BattleEvent via the
<b>setupKnockback()</b>
method.</li>

<li>
<u>Display Inline Attack and Targeting Panel</u> - The Inline Attack and
Targeting Panel are displayed.&nbsp; The Attack panel will set value/pairs
in the BattleEvent according to user input.&nbsp; The Targeting Panel will
set the Target[].TARGET value/pair in the Ability.</li>

<li>
<u>Add Strength Information</u> - Strength Information for the Source will
be added to the BattleEvent's Normal.STR value/pair.</li>

<li>
<u>Copy Dice Information to BattleEvent</u> - Dice Information is copied
to the BattleEvent from the Ability, and Maneuver if one is being used.&nbsp;
Dice copied into the BattleEvent are realized later in the activation process.</li>

<li>
<u>Add Ability Damage Class Information</u> - Execute Ability's <b>adjustDice()</b>
method.&nbsp; AdjustDice should add base damage class information to the
battleEvent.</li>

<li>
<u>Add Manuever Damage Class Information</u> - If a manuever is being used,
execute maneuver's <b>adjustDice()</b> method.&nbsp; AdjustDice for the
maneuver should add manuever damage class information to the battleEvent.</li>

<li>
<u>Add Effect Damage Class Modifiers</u> - For each effect of the Source,
the <b>adjustDice()</b> method will be executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Calculate Final Damage Class</u> - Execute the ChampionsUtilities method
<b>calculateDCs().</b>&nbsp;
CalculateDCs will examine the DC information provided in the battleEvent,
as well as the Normal and Pushed Strength information, and generate a final
damage class for the attack.&nbsp; CalculateDCs will also adjust the Normal
and Pushed Strength information to represent the actual strength used and
will adjust the <i>DamageDie.DIE</i> value/pair appropriately for the attack
type.</li>

<li>
<u>Dispatch to Attack Processing Code</u> - The BattleEvent will then be
dispatched for the appropriate attack processing code for the type of attack
it is, i.e. Autofire, Spread, Area Effect, or single.&nbsp; All attack
processing code basically leads back to the <b>processSingle()</b> method,
which processes an attack on a single target.</li>

<li>
<u>Determine if Target(s) were hit</u> - For each Target identified by
the Attack Processing Code, the following steps occur to determine if a
Target is hit:</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Detemine if Ability always hits</u> - If <b>ability.isAutoHit()</b>
returns true, the attack hits the Target.&nbsp; IsAutoHit can be used to
force a particular ability to automatically hit.&nbsp; Jump to <u>Add Hit
Information to BattleEvent</u> if attack is AutoHit.</li>

<li>
<u>Create Combat Value List</u> - Create's a new CVList object and populates
the object with the Source and Target names, and Generic CV modifiers.&nbsp;
Add Range CV Modifier if <b>ability.isRangedAttack()</b> returns true.</li>

<li>
<u>Copy OCVModifier from BattleEvent to CVList</u> - OCV Modifiers stored
in the OCVModifier[] index of the BattleEvent are copied to the CVList.</li>

<li>
<u>Copy DCVModifier from BattleEvent to CVList</u> - DCV Modifiers stored
in the DCVModifier[] index of the BattleEvent are copied to the CVList.</li>

<li>
<u>Setup Base CV Information</u> - Base CVs for both Source and Target
are copied into CVList.&nbsp; If the attack is an ego attack ( <i>Ability.CVTYPE</i>
== EGO ), CVs are based on ECV.&nbsp; Otherwise, CVs are based on normal
OCV/DCV values.</li>

<li>
<u>Setup Source CV Modifiers</u> - For each Effect of the Source, execute
effect's <b>addECVAttackModifiers()</b> method (if Ego attack) or effect's
<b>addOCVAttackModifiers()</b>
method (for normal attacks).</li>

<li>
<u>Setup Target CV Modifiers</u> - For each Effect of the Target, execute
effect's <b>addECVDefenseModifiers()</b> method (if Ego attack) or effect's
<b>addDCVDefenseModifiers()</b>
method (for normal attacks).</li>

<li>
<u>Display Inline ToHit Panel</u> - The Inline Panel for determining ToHit
is displayed to the User.&nbsp; The ToHit panel will calculate the final
Attack roll necessary and return either Hit or Miss, according to the user's
input and any dice rolls made automatically. The <i>Target[].ROLLNEEDED</i>
and <i>Target[].HITROLL</i> value/pair indexes will be populated approriately.</li>

<li>
<u>Add Hit Information to BattleEvent</u> - The <i>Target[].HIT</i> value/pair
index will be set to either TRUE or FALSE, as appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Process Hit for Target(s)</u> - For any Target(s) that were hit, the
following steps occur:</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Realize Dice</u> - For each Die listed in the <i>Die[]</i> index of
the BattleEvent, the Inline Die Panel is displayed.&nbsp; The Inline Die
Panel populates the BattleEvent with the actual dice values, according
to user input and automatic die rolls.</li>

<li>
<u>Build Triggered Effects List</u> - The Following steps are taken to
generate a list of effects to be applied to the Source or Target depending
on the ability/manuever of the Effect:</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Generate Effect from Ability</u> - The Ability's <b>triggerPower()</b>
method is executed.&nbsp; TriggerPower should populate the effects list
appropriately.&nbsp; After triggerPower is executed, the Ability's <b>generateDefaultEffects()</b>
method is executed.&nbsp; If <b>generateDefaultEffects()</b> returns false,
the Effect List is finished and the next two steps should be skipped.</li>

<li>
<u>Generate Effect from Maneuver</u> - If a maneuver is being used, the
Maneuver's <b>triggerPower()</b> method is executed.&nbsp; TriggerPower
should populate the effects list appropriately.&nbsp; After triggerPower
is executed, the Maneuver's <b>generateDefaultEffects()</b> method is executed.&nbsp;
If <b>generateDefaultEffects()</b> returns false, the Effect List is finished
and the next step should be skipped.</li>

<li>
<u>Generate Default Effect</u> - If both the Ability's and Maneuver's <b>generateDefaultEffects()</b>
returns True, default attack effects are added to the effects list.&nbsp;
Default effects include the standard killing or normal attack damage and
knockback effects.&nbsp; If either the Ability or Maneuver returns False
from <b>generateDefaultEffects()</b>, the Ability and/or Maneuver will
have to generate all necessary damage/knockback effects.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Process Effects</u> - For Each Effect in the Triggered Effects List,
the following process occurs.&nbsp; Note, each triggered effect can be
applied to either the Target of the attack or the Source of the attack,
according to the <i>Effect.TTYPE</i> value/pair.&nbsp; If the effect is
to be applied to the Source, the following is the same with the exception
that all occurances of Target should be replaced with Source.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Gather Target Defense Information</u> - The Target's PD, rPD, ED, and
rED are copied into the effect's <i>xx.DEFENSE</i> value/pairs, where xx
is PD, rPD, ED, and rED, appropriately.</li>

<li>
<u>Process Pre-Defense Methods</u> - The Following list of methods are
processed prior to the Target's defenses being applied.&nbsp; Each effect/advantage/limitation
in the list below has a priority from 0 to 5.&nbsp; This list is run 6
times, starting with priority 0 effects/advantages/limitations, followed
by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 priority effect/advantage/limitation.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Target Effects Predefense Methods</u> - The Target's <b>predefense()
</b>method
is executed for each effect of the currently running priority.</li>

<li>
<u>Source Effects Preattack Methods</u> - The Sources's <b>preattack()
</b>method
is executed for each effect of the currently running priority.</li>

<li>
<u>Ability Advantages Prepower Methods</u> - For each Advantage of the
Ability which has the current priority, the advantage's <b>prepower()</b>
method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Ability Limitation Prepower Methods</u> - For each Limitation of the
Ability which has the current priority, the Limitation's <b>prepower()</b>
method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver Advantages Prepower Methods</u> - If a maneuver is being used,
for each Advantage of the maneuver which has the current priority, the
Advantage's <b>prepower()</b> method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver Limitation Prepower Methods</u> - If a maneuver is being used,
for each Limitation of the maneuver which has the current priority, the
Limitation's <b>prepower()</b> method is executed.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Apply Target Defenses</u> - The Effect is modified according to the
defenses of the target.&nbsp; If the Effect is NND or AVLD, appropriate
User input is requested and defenses applied accordingly.</li>

<li>
<u>Process Post-Defense Methods</u> - The Following list of methods are
processed after the Target's defenses were applied.&nbsp; Each effect/advantage/limitation
in the list below has a priority from 0 to 5.&nbsp; This list is run 6
times, starting with priority 0 effects/advantages/limitations, followed
by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 priority effect/advantage/limitation.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<u>Target Effects Postdefense Methods</u> - The Target's <b>postdefense()
</b>method
is executed for each effect of the currently running priority.</li>

<li>
<u>Source Effects Postattack Methods</u> - The Sources's <b>postattack()
</b>method
is executed for each effect of the currently running priority.</li>

<li>
<u>Ability Advantages Postpower Methods</u> - For each Advantage of the
Ability which has the current priority, the advantage's <b>postpower()</b>
method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Ability Limitation Postpower Methods</u> - For each Limitation of the
Ability which has the current priority, the Limitation's <b>postpower()</b>
method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver Advantages Postpower Methods</u> - If a maneuver is being used,
for each Advantage of the maneuver which has the current priority, the
Advantage's <b>postpower()</b> method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver Limitation Postpower Methods</u> - If a maneuver is being used,
for each Limitation of the maneuver which has the current priority, the
Limitation's <b>postpower()</b> method is executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Process Killing Attack Modification</u> - If the effect being processed
is part of a killing attack, the final amount of stun applied to the Target
should be at minimum the amount of BODY which is applied to the Target.&nbsp;
At priority 2, the processKilling() method of the BattleEngine code will
guarantee this criteria.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Apply Effect to Target</u> - Once the above processing is completed,
the effect will be added to the Target.</li>

<li>
<u>Process Knockback</u> - If the TTYPE of the effect is Target and not
Source, Knockback information for the attack will be calculated and the
BattleEvent will be populated appropriately.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Ability PostTrigger</u> - Once all effects have been applied the Ability's
<b>posttrigger()</b>
method will be executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Maneuver PostTrigger</u> - If a maneuver is being used, the maneuver's<b>
posttrigger()</b> method will be executed.</li>

<li>
<u>Special MoveThrough processing</u> - If the ability or maneuver being
used is a Move Through attack, the damage to the source will be calculated.&nbsp;
The MoveThrough processing will do final knockback generation for the Target
and generate appropriate source damage and apply it to the source using
the same process used above for applying an effect.</li>

<li>
<u>Clear Dice Information</u> - Any Dice modification made to the Ability
are cleared.&nbsp; This step is deprecated as no changes should ever be
made to the ability dice.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<u>Generate and Apply Knockback</u> - The Inline Knockback panel is displayed
and the user rolls final knockback values.&nbsp; Knockback damage is applied
to the Target of the Knockback.&nbsp; Note: This step may have occured
in part during the Special MoveThrough processing.</li>

<li>
<u>Generate and Pay END</u> - The Endurance for the ability is calculated
and removed from the source character.&nbsp; Endurance for normal and pushed
strength is also removed here.</li>

<li>
<u>Deactivate Ability</u> - If the Ability is an instant ability, the ability
must be immediately deactivated.&nbsp; If it is constant/persistant this
step is skipped.&nbsp; The Ability's <b>shutdownPower()</b> method is executed,
and if a maneuver is being used, the Maneuver's <b>shutdownPower()</b>
method is executed.</li>

<br><u>Adjust Source Combat State</u> - The Combat State of the Source
is adjusted according to the ability which was used.&nbsp; The current
active target and/or segment is advanced as appropriate.</ol>
