Effects Overview</h1>
This page details the creation and use of Effects in the Hero Combat System.&nbsp;
Effects are objects which can be applied to any target object to modify
the attribute, abilities, and actions of the Target.

<a NAME="Understand Effects Objects"></a>Understand Effects Objects</h2>
Effects are one of the most versitile objects in HCS.&nbsp; The following
section details many of the options which are available when creating effects
of any time.
<h3>
<a NAME="Standard vs Custom Effects"></a>Standard vs Custom Effects</h3>
Generally speaking, any effect in HCS can be catogorized as either a standard
effect or a custom effect.&nbsp; A standard effect is an effect which modifies
target attributes or abilities in through either damage, aid, drain, or
setting an absolute value.&nbsp; A custom effect is an effect which does
anything which does not fall under the standard effect type.&nbsp; Custom
effects include everything from knockdown to blindness to death.
<p>Standard effects are almost always implemented by creating a direct
instance of the effect class.&nbsp; Standard effects do their job via the
use of subeffects.&nbsp; See Subeffect below for more information.&nbsp;
All of the mechanism to create and apply a standard effect to a target
is implemented in the base effect class.
<p>Custom effects are implemented by creating a subclass of the effect
class.&nbsp; Although custom effects can use subeffects like Standard effects,
they generally do not, instead relying on custom methods to modify the
way a target behaves.
<h3>
<a NAME="Subeffects"></a>Subeffects</h3>
Subeffects are a way of modifying a targets attributes in a predefined
set of ways.&nbsp; Any effect can contain subeffects.&nbsp; The effects
class handles all known subeffect types automatically.&nbsp; The following
table list the standard set of subeffects the base effect class implements
and applies to targets:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b>Type</b></td>

<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Aid</td>

<td>Aid adds points to the attribute being modified.&nbsp; There is no
maximum to the number of point which aid will apply to the attribute.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Limited_Aid</td>

<td>Limited_Aid adds points to attribute being modified.&nbsp; Unlike Aid,
Limited_Aid will only increase the attribute up to the targets normal maximum
for the attribute.&nbsp; Limited_Aid will have not effect against attributes
which have not previously been reduces by damage, drain, or set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Damage</td>

<td>Damage removes points from the attribute being modified.&nbsp; There
is no limit to the minimum value of the attribute being damaged.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Drain</td>

<td>Drain removes points from the attribute being modified.&nbsp; There
is no limit to the minimum value of the attribute being drained.&nbsp;
Damage and Drain work in the exact same way.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Limited_Drain</td>

<td>Limited_Drain removes point from the attribute being modified.&nbsp;
Unlike Drain, Limited_Drain will not decrease an attribute below zero.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Set</td>

<td>Set sets the attribute being modified to some value, regardless of
what it was to start with.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A subeffect can modify either a character stat or an ability.&nbsp;
If a stat is being modified, the amount of subeffect applied can be specified
in either character points or stat point.&nbsp; If an ability is being
modified, the amount of subeffect applied must be specified in character
point.&nbsp; Currently, modifying the character points of an ability produces
no effect.
<p>For more information on using Subeffects, see <a href="#Creating Subeffects">Creating
Subeffects</a> below.
<h3>
<a NAME="Instant, Constant, and Linked Effects"></a>Instant, Persistent,
and Linked Effects</h3>
Whether an effect is a standard effect or a custom effect, it can be catogorized
as either Instant, Persistent, or Linked.
<p>Instant effects are applied to the target, and then thrown away.&nbsp;
The changes that the effect causes are retained, but the target does not
maintain any information about the effect object inself.&nbsp; Examples
of instant effects include the damage from an attack or the aid from a
healing ability.
<p>Persistent effects, once applied to the target, stay attached to the
target until some event removes them.&nbsp; Persistent effects can be used
to maintain information about the state of a target, such as dead, unconscious,
or knocked down.&nbsp; They can also be used to watch the target in some
way, so additional effects can be triggered at a later point in time.
<p>Linked effects are a subclass of persistent effects.&nbsp; Linked effects
are associated with an ability.&nbsp; As long as the ability is activated,
the effect remains attached to the target.&nbsp; When the ability is deactivated,
linked effects associated with that ability are removed.&nbsp; Linked effects
can be used with effects that only occur while a power is active, such
as force field or armor.
<p>The effects class contains all the necessary code to automatically handle
instant, persistent, and linked effects.&nbsp; Once an effect is specified
as a certain type, it will behave appropriately for that type.
<h3>
<a NAME="Undoability"></a>Undoability</h3>
Like most things in HCS, effects are completely undoable.&nbsp; The majority
of the work necessary to undo the application of an effect to a target
is taken care of by the base effect class.&nbsp; However, if you implement
custom effects and override methods from the effects class, you may need
to make sure the effect is still completely undoable and redoable.
<h3>
<a NAME="Unique Effects"></a>Unique Effects</h3>
Effects are either unique or not unique.&nbsp; If an effect is unique,
only one instance of the effect can be applied to any one target.&nbsp;
Uniqueness only matters with constant and linked effects, since instant
effect disappear immediately.
<h3>
<a NAME="Hidden Effects"></a>Hidden Effects</h3>
Effects can be marked as hidden.&nbsp; If an effect is marked as hidden,
it will not be shown in the Effects list of the target it is applied to.
All house keeping effects, such as combat level watchers, should be set
to hidden.
<h2>
<a NAME="Writing Effects Code"></a>Writing Effect Code</h2>
This section covers the writing of effects.&nbsp; If you are creating standard
effects, you will probably only need to look at the <a href="#Creating Effects">Creating
Effects</a> and&nbsp; <a href="#Creating Subeffects">Creating Subeffects</a>.&nbsp;
If you are creating a custom effects, look at the <a href="#Creating Effects">Creating
Effects</a> and <a href="#Creating Custom Effects">Creating Custom Effects</a>
sections.
<h3>
<a NAME="Creating Effects"></a>Creating Effects</h3>
A standard effect can be created with any of the effect class constructors.&nbsp;
Nothing special needs to be done to construct and effect.
<p>A custom effect will typically be a subclass of the effect class.&nbsp;
The subclass constructor should call one of the effect class constructors
to complete construction.
<h3>
<a NAME="Creating Subeffects"></a>Creating Subeffects</h3>
Once either a standard or custom effect has been created, subeffects can
be added to that effect.&nbsp; The effect method <b>addSubeffectInfo()</b>
can be used to add subeffects to an effect.&nbsp; <b>AddSubeffectInfo()</b>
requires the following parameter:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 >
<tr>
<td><b>Parameter</b></td>

<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Name</td>

<td>This is a unique name for the subeffect.&nbsp; This name is often used
as a lookup index by advatnages, limitations, and other effects.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Type</td>

<td>This indicates what type of subeffect it is: Aid, Limited_Aid, Damage,
Drain, Limited_Drain, Set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Defense Type</td>

<td>This indicates the type of defense the target gets against this subeffect:
ED, PD, rPD, rED, None.&nbsp; Note: Killing attacks should be specified
as PD or ED, not rPD or rED.&nbsp; The BattleEngine converts the defense
to rPD/rED appropriately.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Defense Special</td>

<td>This indicates if the subeffects should be applied in a non-standard
way.&nbsp; Currently implemented ways are: Normal, Killing, NND, AVLD.&nbsp;
Note: The stun of a killing attack should be specified as Killing Special.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Versus Type</td>

<td>Indicates what target attribute the subeffect should be applied against:
STAT, STATCP, ABILITY.&nbsp; STAT indicates the attribute is a stat, and
the value metric is in stat points.&nbsp; STATCP indicates the attribute
is a stat, but the value metric is in character points.&nbsp; Ability indicates
the attribute is an ability, with a character point metric.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Versus Stat</td>

<td>Indicates the attribute to apply subeffect to.&nbsp; If VersusType
== STAT or STATCP, Versus Stat should be the string abbreviate of the Stat,
such as STR, DEX, CON.&nbsp; If the VersusType == ability, the versus stat
should be an ability object belonging to the target.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Value</td>

<td>Amount to change attribute of target.&nbsp; Metric is determined by
versus type.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Example:
<p>In the following code, a new standard effect is created and two subeffects
are added to the effect.
<pre><tt>Effect effect = new Effect( "HA Damage", "INSTANT" );

effect.addSubeffectInfo( "HAStun", "DAMAGE", "PD", "NORMAL", "STAT", "STUN", new Integer(10) );
effect.addSubeffectInfo( "HABody", "DAMAGE", "PD", "NORMAL", "STAT", "BODY", new Integer(5) );</tt></pre>
The first subeffect is a 10 point Damage subeffect, applied with normal
PD defense against the Stun stat of the target..
<br>The second subeffect is a 5 point Damage subeffect, applied with normal
PD defense against the Body stat of the target.
<h3>
<a NAME="Creating Custom Effects"></a>Creating Custom Effects</h3>
Custom effects are typically more complicated to implement then standard
effects, but can perform a wide variety of tasks.&nbsp; Before you can
understand how custom effects work, it is important that you understant
the <a href="Activation Overview.html">Ability Activation Overview</a>.
<p>The sections below explain the typical steps necessary to create a custom
effect.
<h4>
Custom Constructor</h4>
The first step in creating a custom effect is to write a constructor.&nbsp;
The constructor can do whatever initialization is necessary for the effect,
but it should call one of the effect superclass constructors to initialize
the standard effect parameters.
<h4>
Custom AddEffect Method (Optional)</h4>
Whenever an effect is applied to a target, the effect's<b> addEffect()</b>
method is called with the target as a parameter.&nbsp; The <b>addEffect()</b>
method can be overriden to provide custom functionality when the effect
is applied.
<p>The <b>AddEffect()</b> code can perform a variety of tasks, including:
<ul>
<li>
Check Target for prerequisites or restrictions on this effect.&nbsp; For
example, the Unconscious effect first checks to make sure the target doesn't
have the effect dead already and won't apply itself if the target is already
dead.</li>

<li>
Remove Conflicting Effects.&nbsp; For example, the Dead effect removes
the Unconscious effect from a target before applying the dead effect.</li>

<li>
Apply custom subeffects.&nbsp; For example, the END effect is built using
subeffects.&nbsp; However, the subeffects are of type END instead of damage.&nbsp;
The END effect knows how to specifically apply END to a target.</li>
</ul>
Sometime during the <b>addEffect()</b> code, make sure the superclass <b>addEffect()</b>
method is called.&nbsp; The inherited method contains code to actually
maintain the effect list of the target and apply known subeffects to the
target.
<h4>
Custom RemoveEffect Method (Optional)</h4>
Whenever an effect is remove from a target, the effect's <b>removeEffect()</b>
method is called.&nbsp; The <b>removeEffect()</b> method can be overriden
to provide custom removal functionality.&nbsp; Like <b>addEffect()</b>,
make sure the superclass <b>removeEffect()</b> method is always called
somewhere within <b>removeEffect()</b>.
<h4>
Other Custom Methods</h4>
The following table details the other methods that can be overriden to
provide additional functionality.&nbsp; Most of these methods are called
in the course of ability activation and can greatly affect the way abilities
function.
